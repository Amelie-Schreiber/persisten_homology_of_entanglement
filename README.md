# persistent_homology_of_entanglement
This repo attempts to implements the following paper [Persistent homology of quantum entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10214) starting from graph states with controlled random unitary matrix gates as entangling gates between qubits. Also see [Interaction graph-based profiling of quantum benchmarks for improving quantum circuit mapping techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06640)
