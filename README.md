# persistent_homology_of_entanglement
This repo attempts to implements the following paper [Persistent homology of quantum entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10214) starting from graph states with controlled random unitary matrix gates as entangling gates between qubits. Once this is done we are working on implementing the function to compute inverse von Neumann mutual information between qubits. This can then be used in [Scikit-TDA](https://github.com/scikit-tda) to compute the various topological data analysis objects such as $\alpha$, Vietoris-Rips, and Cech-complexes, persistence images and diagrams, etc. We also recommend [Giotto-TDA](https://github.com/giotto-ai).

As a further application, we mention the use of $2$-parameter persistent homology as mention in the concluding remarks of [Multiparameter Persistent Homology-Generic Structures and Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11433). In particular, we allow the controlled random unitaries to be parametrized (by time) and, in addition to the inverse von Neumann mutual information, we use it as a second parameter to obtain a bifiltered simplicial complex. 

Using [Rivet](https://github.com/rivetTDA/rivet) we can then compute presentations of persistence modules. Presentations are only the first two terms of the free resolution of the persistence modules, so more work is needed to see the full mathematical theory mentioned in [Persistent homology of quantum entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10214) realized and implemented.
