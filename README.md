This repo attempts to implements the following paper [Persistent homology of quantum entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10214) starting from graph states with controlled random unitary matrix gates as entangling gates between qubits. Also see [Interaction graph-based profiling of quantum benchmarks for improving quantum circuit mapping techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06640)

Dividing the quantum circuit into time-steps and computing the reduced density matrix operator for each time step allows us to construct a weighted interaction graph, where the weights are given by the von Neumann entanglement entropy between each pair of qubits (or alternatively quantum mutual information). By considering the entanglement entropy (or the quantum mutual information) as a parameter, we obtain a bifiltration of the weighted interaction graph.

This bifiltration can be used to compute the 2-parameter persistent homology of the weighted interaction graph. The first parameter is time, and the second parameter is the entanglement entropy. The persistent homology captures the topological features of the graph that persist across different time-steps and entanglement entropy values.

The 2-parameter persistent homology of the weighted interaction graph can be used to study the evolution of the entanglement structure of the quantum circuit. This can provide insights into the quantum information processing that is happening in the circuit, and can help us understand the role of entanglement in quantum computation. This can again be utilized in understanding and improving the transpiling process, especially when hardware backend constraints are topological in nature. 

Overall, computing the 2-parameter persistent homology of a bifiltration constructed from a quantum circuit can be a useful tool for studying the entanglement structure of the circuit and gaining insights into the quantum information processing that is happening. We can then use [Rivet](https://github.com/rivetTDA/rivet)
